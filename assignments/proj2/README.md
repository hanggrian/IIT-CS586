## Problem 1

> MDA-EFSM model for the *Gas Pump* components
>
> 1.  A list of meta events for the MDA-EFSM
> 1.  A list of meta actions for the MDA-EFSM with their descriptions
> 1.  A state diagram of the MDA-EFSM
> 1.  Pseudo-code of all operations of the Input Processors of Gas Pumps: *GP-1*
      and *GP-2*

## Problem 2

> Class diagram(s) of the MDA of the *Gas Pump* components. In your design, you
  **MUST** use the following OO design patterns:
>
> 1.  State pattern
> 1.  Strategy pattern
> 1.  Abstract factory pattern

## Problem 3

> For each class in the class diagram(s), you should:
>
> 1.  Describe the purpose of the class, i.e., responsibilities.
> 1.  Describe the responsibility of each operation supported by each class.

## Problem 4

> Dynamics. Provide sequence diagrams for two Scenarios:
>
> 1.  Scenario-I should show how one liter of gas is dispensed in *GasPump-1,*
      i.e., the following sequence of operations is issued: `activate(4.1)`,
      `start()`, `payCash(5.2)`, `startPump()`, `pumpLiter()`, `pumpLiter()`.
> 1.  Scenario-II should show how one gallon of Regular gas is dispensed in
      *GasPump-2,* i.e., the following sequence of operations is issued:
      `activate(4, 7)`, `start()`, `payDebit(123)`, `pin(124)`, `pin(123)`,
      `regular()`, `startPump()`, `pumpGallon()`, `fullTank()`.
